    "SimpleInvestment": "This module is meant to expose you to how your money might grow in the stock market. Below, you have the option to specify a stock, start year, end year, and initial investment. If you aren't familiar with any stocks right now, you can browse through some popular ones which are provided. At the end, hit the 'Invest Button!' which appears to see how your money would grow in this simulation!",
    "MonthlyInvestment": "There's more to investing than just putting in a one time sum of money. Many investors choose to put in 10-15% of their gross income into the stock market every month in order to continue having a portion of their wealth grow. Enter your annual salary below to get a recommended amount of money that you should be investing monthly into the market. Add all of your unnecessary expenses (e.g. eating out, streaming subscriptions, ordering delivery, etc...) below to see how much money your expenses are costing you over time by missing out on market gains.",
    "ActiveTrading": "This module is meant to show how your buy and sell parameters can affect your portfolio performance. It allows you to set highs and lows to buys and sells and will compare that strategies' performance against a standard Buy-and-Wait strategy. Be aware that transactions always follow a dyad pair of Buy and then Sell (repeat). Different parameters work better or worse depending on the stock and time frame. Good luck!",
    "TaxEffects": "This module will allow you to see how living in different states will affect how much profit you actually make off of your returns. After setting the initial simulation data, choose up to four different states, and run the simulation to compare how your returns will be taxed based on your location!"
