# InvestmentStategies - Overview 

## Simple Investment

This module is meant to expose you to how your money might grow in the stock market. Users have the option to specify a stock, start year, end year, and initial investment. If they aren't familiar with any stocks, they can browse through some popular stocks which are provided. At the end, hit the 'Invest Button!' which appears to see how your money would grow in this simulation!

## Monthly Investment 

There's more to investing than just putting in a one time sum of money. Many investors choose to put in 10-15% of their gross income into the stock market every month in order to continue having a portion of their wealth grow. Users can enter their annual salary to get a recommended amount of money that you should be investing monthly into the market. They then add all of their unnecessary expenses (e.g. eating out, streaming subscriptions, ordering delivery, etc...) to see how much money their expenses are costing them over time by missing out on market gains.

## Active Trading 

This module is meant to show how buy and sell parameters can affect portfolio performance. It allows the user to set highs and lows to buys and sells and will compare that strategies' performance against a standard Buy-and-Wait strategy. Be aware that transactions always follow a dyad pair of Buy and then Sell (repeat). Different parameters work better or worse depending on the stock and time frame. Good luck!"

## Tax Effects 

This module will allow you to see how living in different states will affect how much profit you actually make off of your returns. After setting the initial simulation data, choose up to four different states, and run the simulation to compare how your returns will be taxed based on your location!
